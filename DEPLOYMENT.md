# Deployment

Using angular-cli-ghpages to deploy.

The command:

```
npm run deploy
```

**NOTE:** Because we are using an unpublished library **negotiate-ninja-lib** to share code with browser extension apps, the build/deployment is fucked up (see _Building/deploying with local library_ in [KNOWN PROBLEMS](KNOWN-PROBLEMS.ms)).

**NOTE:** See _Deployment with standalone angular-cli-ghpages command_ in [KNOWN PROBLEMS](KNOWN-PROBLEMS.ms).
