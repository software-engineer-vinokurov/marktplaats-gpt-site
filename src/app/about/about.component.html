    <h2 class="mat-h2">History and Background</h2>

    <!-- [Share the story of how "Negotiate Ninja" was founded, its journey, and major milestones.
    This adds a personal touch and helps build a connection with the audience.] -->

    <p>
      The story of Negotiate Ninja began with a simple yet innovative idea. Faced with the challenge of frequent and
      often unreasonable discount requests on marktplaats.nl, the concept for Negotiate Ninja was born on a Friday
      morning
      in October 2023. The initial development led to the creation of a command-line tool that could list marktplaats
      conversations and suggest responses using ChatGPT, transforming the way negotiations were handled on the
      platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project evolved quickly. The tool was integrated into a Telegram Bot, becoming a sophisticated selling
      assistant
      capable of fetching messages, providing product descriptions from marktplaats.nl, and offering enhanced ChatGPT
      suggestions for responses. This feature allowed users to regenerate suggestions if needed, adding a layer of
      customization and control.
    </p>

    <p>
      Early success was evident. Even in its initial version, the tool demonstrated its potential by facilitating a
      successful deal, showcasing the effectiveness of ChatGPT's elaborate and persuasive answers. As
      development progressed, new features were added, including the ability to change the context used by ChatGPT, save
      authentication cookies for marktplaats.nl, and manage user activation and quota on OpenAI usage. These
      advancements
      were critical steps towards making Negotiate Ninja a paid service, with a focus on user experience and
      sustainability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The journey of Negotiate Ninja has been marked by innovation and user-focused development, with ongoing efforts to
      partner with marktplaats.nl for API integration and expand the service's capabilities. From its
      inception, Negotiate Ninja has been more than just a tool; it's a testament to the power of AI in enhancing online
      negotiation and a commitment to making digital interactions more efficient and effective.
